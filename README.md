## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Projec is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It focuses on backend systems, database desig, API Development and application security.

---

### Project Objectives

* Master collaborative team workflows using Github.
* Deepen understanding on backend architecture and database design principles.
* Understand how to implement advance security measures on API Development.
* Gain proficiiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficiend deployment.
* Strengthening the ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.

---

#### Technologies used

This project uses the following teck track. `Django`, `MySQL` and `GraphQL`

## Team Roles

* Business Analyst. A Business Analyst dives deep into a customers workfolows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help a client fomulate what their wants look like and align to a custmers vision with what the development team is producing.

* Product Owner. The Product Owner is the decision maker. The PO provides a vision of the product without diving deep into how it is technically implemented.

* Project Manager. PM is responsible for distributing tasks across team members, planning work activities and updating the project status.

* UI/UX Designer. They are responsible to create easy-to-use and eye-pleasing interfaces for users.

* Software Architect. They make executive software design decisions on behalf of the app development team. They decide which services and databases should commmunicate together.

* Front--End Developer. They create the part of the part of an application that users interact with.

* Back-End Developer. They implement the core of an app, its algorithms and business logic.

* Quality Assuarance Engineer. QA Engineer verifies whether an application meets the requirements.

* Database Administrator. Manages database design, indexing and optimization.

* DevOps Engineer. Handles deployment, monitoring and scaling of the backend services.

## Technology Track

* Django - This is a Python Programming Language used for development of the backend logic of an application. Its main purpose to link the Database and the Front-End.
* MySQL, GraphQL && Postgres - This are relational database management systems.
* CI/CD Pipelnes -  These are automated pipelines for testing and deploying code chnages.
* Celery - This is for handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
* Redis - This is for caching and session management.
* Docker -  This is a containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.

## Database Design

The Key Entities of the Database are as follows;
* Users: A user can have multiple bookings and multiple listings. A user can also do payment and reviews.
* Property: Properties are owned by users and can be booked by users.
* Booking: A user can book a BnB and a BnB can be booked by multiple users.
* Payment: A user can make payment for a booking.
* Reviews: A user can leave a review for a BnB.

## Feature Breakdown

* User Management: This feature is to enable user to do their registration and profile management. The aim of this feature is to enable learners to learn how to create user authentication endpoints that enables user to register, authenticate and manage their profiles.
* Property Management: This is a feature that enables property listing, updates and retrieval of property details. This is to enable learners to create an endpoint that has the CRUD operations for property listing.
* Booking System:  The main aim of this feature to enable users to reserve properties and manage their booking details. This feature will enable learners to learn how to create a booking mechanism to make, update, and manage bookings including check-in and check-out details.
* Payment Processing: This enables a user to make payment for a booking. This will enable learners to learn how to intergrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
* Review System: This is to allow users to leave reviews and ratings of properties. Learners will create an endpoint to post and manage reviews.
* Data Optimization: This is to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations. This is to enable learners to learn how to create a fast, secure, modern database.

## API Security

API Security plays a crucial role in this project development. In a system, a user can be a property owner or just a user booking property. This two users should have different roles in the project. A user who is a property owner can create and update a listing in the platform. Their permissions would be the same and that's where API Security plays a crucial role. API security ensures only allowed users can access and manipulate certain data. This prevents unauthorized access to sensitive data.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This refers to a series of automated steps that streamline the software development process from code changes to deployment. CI stands for Continoues Intergration while CD stands for Continous Deployment.

* CI - This automates merging of code changes from multiple developers into a central repository. This is useful to detect intergration issues early.
* CD - This automates the release of code changes to various envrionments, including testing and production.

The two conncepts are useful to ensure to ensure that no conflicts in the code that could make the application to crash.
